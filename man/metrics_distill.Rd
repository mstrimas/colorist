\title{Distill a raster stack into a set of metrics for each cells}
\usage{
metrics_distill(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{RasterStack with each layer typically corresponding to the
distribution of an individual or species at a given time interval.}
}
\value{
A RasterStack with four layers:
\itemize{
\item \code{intensity}: the maximum pixel intensity across all layers
\item \code{intensity_mean}: the mean pixel intensity across all layers
\item \code{layer}: the layer number associated with the maximum intensity.
\item \code{specificity}: the amount of variation between layers for each cell, this
is a measure of seasonality if the layers represents different times of
year.
\item \code{n_layers}: the number of intervals with a non-NA pixel value
}

Here intensity is the result of dividing all cell values by the maximum
cell value across all layers. This maximum value is stored as the
\code{"maximum"} attribute.
