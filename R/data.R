#' eBird Status & Trends Field Sparrow occurrence probability
#'
#' A [RasterStack][raster::RasterStack-class] of the expected probability of
#' occurrence of Field Sparrow from the [eBird Status &
#' Trends](https://ebird.org/science/status-and-trends) project. Each of the 12
#' layers in the stack represent the estimated occurrence for a given month of
#' the year over a regular grid of points covering the full range of the
#' species. To reduce file size, these data have been aggregated from the native
#' 2.96 km spatial resolution and weekly temporal resolution to monthly, 14.8 km
#' resolution.
#'
#' For further details on these data, and to access the data for more species,
#' consult the [documentation for the `ebirdst`
#' package](https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/ebirdst/).

#' African Elephant utilization distributions
#'
#' A [RasterStack][raster::RasterStack-class] of the [utilization
#' distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization_distribution) for two
#' individual African Elephants in Etosha National Park in 2011. Cell values
#' represent the probability density that an elephant was found at a given
#' location within the year and the two layers contain data for the two
#' individual elephants. Utilization distributions were generated using the
#' `adehabitatHR` package from GPS tracking data. W. Kilian, W.M. Getz, R.
#' Zidon, and M. Tsalyuk graciously provided permission to use their data for
#' visualization purposes.

#' Fisher utilization distributions
#'
#' A [RasterStack][raster::RasterStack-class] of the [utilization
#' distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilization_distribution) for a
#' single fisher in New York state over the course of nine nights in April 2011.
#' Cell values represent the probability density that the individual was found
#' at a given location between sunset and sunrise and the nine layers represent
#' nine nights of data. Utilization distributions were generated using the
#' `adehabitatHR` package from GPS tracking data.
