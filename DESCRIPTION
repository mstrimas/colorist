Description: Functions are provided for coloring and visualizing wildlife 
    distributions in space-time using raster data. In addition to enabling 
    display of sequential change in distributions through the use of small 
    multiples and animations, colorist provides functions for extracting several 
    features of interest from a sequence of distributions and for visualizing 
    those features using HCL (hue-chroma-luminance) color palettes. Resulting 
    maps allow for "fair" visual comparison of intensity values (e.g., 
    occurrence, abundance, or density) across space and time and can be used 
    to address questions about where, when, and how consistently a species, 
    group, or individual is likely to be found.
